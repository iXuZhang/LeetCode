Array vs Linked List
Advantage of Linked List over array
(1) The size of Linked List is dynamic, and the size of array is fixed.
(2) Insertion and Deletion time is constant. Array O(n).

Drawbacks of Linked List compared with array
(1) Access by Index is not allowed.
(2) Use more space to store the address of the next node.
